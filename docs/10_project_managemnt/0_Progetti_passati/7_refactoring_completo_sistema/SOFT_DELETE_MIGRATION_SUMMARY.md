# Soft Delete Migration - Phase 2 Summary

## Overview
Completed the migration from dual soft delete fields (`isDeleted` + `deletedAt`) to a single standardized `deletedAt` field across all entities.

## Changes Made

### 1. Data Migration
- Executed SQL migration script to synchronize `eliminato` (isDeleted) with `deleted_at` (deletedAt)
- Created backup tables for data safety
- Updated records where `eliminato = true` to set appropriate `deleted_at` timestamps

### 2. Schema Updates
Removed `isDeleted` field (mapped to `eliminato`) from the following entities:

- **Company** - Removed `isDeleted` field, kept `deletedAt`
- **Course** - Removed `isDeleted` field, kept `deletedAt`
- **CourseSchedule** - Removed `isDeleted` field, kept `deletedAt`
- **CourseEnrollment** - Removed `isDeleted` field, kept `deletedAt`
- **CourseSession** - Removed `isDeleted` field, kept `deletedAt`
- **ScheduleCompany** - Removed `isDeleted` field, kept `deletedAt`
- **Attestato** - Removed `isDeleted` field, kept `deletedAt`
- **TemplateLink** - Removed `isDeleted` field, kept `deletedAt`
- **LetteraIncarico** - Removed `isDeleted` field, kept `deletedAt`
- **RegistroPresenze** - Removed `isDeleted` field, kept `deletedAt`
- **RegistroPresenzePartecipante** - Removed `isDeleted` field, kept `deletedAt`
- **Preventivo** - Removed `isDeleted` field, kept `deletedAt`
- **PreventivoPartecipante** - Removed `isDeleted` field, kept `deletedAt`
- **PreventivoAzienda** - Removed `isDeleted` field, kept `deletedAt`
- **Fattura** - Removed `isDeleted` field, kept `deletedAt`
- **FatturaAzienda** - Removed `isDeleted` field, kept `deletedAt`
- **Permission** - Removed `isDeleted` field, kept `deletedAt`
- **TestDocument** - Removed `isDeleted` field, kept `deletedAt`
- **TestPartecipante** - Removed `isDeleted` field, kept `deletedAt`

### 3. Database Synchronization
- Applied schema changes using `npx prisma db push`
- Generated updated Prisma Client
- Verified database structure changes

## Next Steps

### Backend Code Updates Required
Update all backend code to use only `deletedAt` for soft delete operations:

1. **Repository/Service Layer**:
   - Remove references to `isDeleted` field
   - Update soft delete logic to use `deletedAt: new Date()` instead of `isDeleted: true`
   - Update queries to filter by `deletedAt: null` instead of `isDeleted: false`

2. **API Endpoints**:
   - Update delete endpoints to set `deletedAt` timestamp
   - Update list/get endpoints to filter by `deletedAt: null`

3. **Validation and Business Logic**:
   - Update any validation rules that referenced `isDeleted`
   - Update business logic that checked soft delete status

### Example Code Changes

**Before:**
```typescript
// Soft delete
await prisma.company.update({
  where: { id },
  data: { isDeleted: true, deletedAt: new Date() }
});

// Query active records
const companies = await prisma.company.findMany({
  where: { isDeleted: false }
});
```

**After:**
```typescript
// Soft delete
await prisma.company.update({
  where: { id },
  data: { deletedAt: new Date() }
});

// Query active records
const companies = await prisma.company.findMany({
  where: { deletedAt: null }
});
```

## Migration Status
✅ **Completed**: Schema migration and database synchronization  
⏳ **Pending**: Backend code updates to use standardized soft delete pattern

## Files Modified
- `backend/prisma/schema.prisma` - Removed `isDeleted` fields from all entities
- `migrate_soft_delete_phase2.sql` - Data migration script
- `migrate_soft_delete_simple.sql` - Simplified migration script

## Database Verification
Confirmed that:
- `eliminato` column has been removed from all tables
- `deleted_at` column remains and functions correctly
- Prisma Client has been regenerated with updated schema
